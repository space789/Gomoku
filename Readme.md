# GOMOKU

## Description

Gomoku is a board game for two players that is played on a 15x15 board. The players take turns placing stones of their color on the intersections of the board. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## My implementation

I implemented the game in C# using the Windows Forms framework. The game is played on a 17x17 board. The players can choose to play against each other or against the computer. The computer uses a simple algorithm to determine the best move. The algorithm is based on the minimax algorithm. The computer will try to maximize its score and minimize the score of the opponent. The score is calculated by counting the number of stones in a row. The computer will try to place a stone in a position that will maximize the score. The computer will also try to block the opponent from winning.

## How to play

You can choose the game mode from the menu. You can choose to play against the computer or against another player. You can also choose the color of the stones. The game starts with the player who has the black stones. The players take turns placing stones on the board. The goal is to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends when one of the players forms an unbroken chain of five stones. The player who forms the chain of five stones wins the game.

## How to run

You can run the game by opening the `Gomoku.exe` file.

## Future improvements

I would like to improve the algorithm to make it more efficient (AI). I would also like to add a feature that allows the player to choose the difficulty level of the computer.
